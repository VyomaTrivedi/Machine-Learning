Language used : python

The file can be run using python idle(2.7.12)
The files : ID3.py and dec_tree.py should be kept in the same folder along with the training and testing data files

On running the ID3 file(using F5 command) the user will be prompted to enter
1) The path of training data file   (example : train-win.dat)
2) Testing data file                (example : test-win.dat)
3) Pruning factor                   (example : 0.2 (float value) )

The code will thus produce the following outputs:

1) The decision tree

2) Pre-pruning

   Number of training instances
   Number of training attributes
   Total number of nodes in the tree
   Number of leaf nodes in the tree
   The accuracy achieved on the training data

   Number of training instances
   Number of training attributes
   The accuracy achieved on the testing data

3) The pruned decision tree

4) Post-pruning
   
   Number of training instances
   Number of training attributes
   Total number of nodes in the tree
   Number of leaf nodes in the tree
   The accuracy achieved on the training data

   Number of training instances
   Number of training attributes
   The accuracy achieved on the testing data
